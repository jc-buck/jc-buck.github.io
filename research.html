    <p>My PhD research provides a comparative analysis of the patient-centric approach to end-of-life decision-making for patients lacking capacity, viewed through the lens of human dignity. I explore the extensive German dignity jurisprudence and compares it to the more nascent dignity jurisprudence in England and Wales, interrogating the role and impact of the protection of human dignity within the end-of-life context. Specifically, I consider how human dignity might provide the basis for consistent, patient-centric decision-making under s 4 Mental Capacity Act 2005 by setting the best interests approach into comparison with the German presumed will frameworks. I am very fortunate to be supervised by Dr Sam Halliday and Prof Emma Cave.
