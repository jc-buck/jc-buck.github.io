    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>I am a first-year PhD candidate and Senior Tutor at <a href=https://www.durham.ac.uk/law>Durham Law School</a>. I hold an LLB and MJur, both from Durham. At present, I teach and guest lecture on the LLB Law and Medicine module, and I also teach LLB Tort Law.</p>
    <p>Over the past year, I have acted as a convenor for the <a href=http://www.durham.ac.uk/cells>Durham Centre for Ethics and Law in the Life Sciences (CELLS)</a> and I have worked as a research associate to Professor Emma Cave, working on the upcoming seventh edition of <i>Medicine, Patients, and the Law</i>. I also worked as a research and teaching assistant on the LLM programme.</p>
    
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>My PhD thesis is supervised by Dr Sam Halliday and Prof Emma Cave and explores the value of human dignity in end-of-life decision-making. I approach this comparatively, examining the best interests frameworks in England and Wales alongside the presumed will approach under German law. I propose that the patient-centric values of the decision-making process in England and Wales have been poorly understood and inconsistently applied.</p>
    <p>I argue that greater engagement with the principle of human dignity in English law, informed by the application of the principle in German law, will provide clarity on what the patient-centric approach requires and how patients can be treated as individuals rather than objects of medical interest.</p>
