    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>I am a PhD student at <a href=https://www.durham.ac.uk/law>Durham Law School</a>, funded by the <a href=https://www.ukri.org/councils/ahrc/>Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)</a> through the <a href=http://www.northernbridge.ac.uk/>Northern Bridge Consortium</a>. I am also the Senior Tutor in Law, responsible for providing pedagogical guidance and professional development support to the department's part-time tutors. I hold a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) and Master of Jurisprudence (MJur), both from Durham, and hold AFHEA and AIoL status.</p>

    <p>Currently, I teach on the LLB Law and Medicine module. I have previously been engaged with teaching on the LLB Tort Law module and the LLM Frontiers in Biolaw and Global Environmental Law modules. I employ research and EDI-led practices in my teaching, which is consistently ranked among the best of all teaching in the department, and is <a href="testimonials.html"> highly regarded by students</a>. Aside from this, I am a co-convenor of the Centre for Ethics and Law in the Life Sciences (CELLS).</p>
      
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>My PhD research provides a comparative analysis of the patient-centric approach to end-of-life decision-making for patients lacking capacity, viewed through the lens of human dignity. I explore the extensive German dignity jurisprudence and compares it to the more nascent dignity jurisprudence in England and Wales, interrogating the role and impact of the protection of human dignity within the end-of-life context. Specifically, I consider how human dignity might provide the basis for consistent, patient-centric decision-making under s 4 Mental Capacity Act 2005 by setting the best interests approach into comparison with the German presumed will frameworks. I am very fortunate to be supervised by Dr Sam Halliday and Prof Emma Cave.
